WHat is going on there?
I talked to John on email.  We talked about some computer stuff that's it.

I went bike riding in the rain, it was not that cold.

We went to the museum in SF yesterday it was $3 to get in and they had
free food.  At the same time was a SF Giants game, when we got done we
had to take the train with all the Giants fans, they are 1/2 drunk.

Yo.  I've been working on my running website.  I'm using jquery and the jqplot plugin.  I'm not too far away from having a prototype to launch.  

You used jqplot right?  If not, I think you would like it.

Hello,

Since you are an owner of at least one Google Groups group that uses the customized welcome message, pages or files, we are writing to inform you that we will no longer be supporting these features starting February 2011. We made this decision so that we can focus on improving the core functionalities of Google Groups -- mailing lists and forum discussions.  Instead of these features, we encourage you to use products that are designed specifically for file storage and page creation, such as Google Docs and Google Sites.

For example, you can easily create your pages on Google Sites and share the site with the members of your group. You can also store your files on the site by attaching files to pages on the site. If you're just looking for a place to upload your files so that your group members can download them, we suggest you try Google Docs. You can upload files and share access with either a group or an individual, assigning either edit or download only access to the files.

you have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to Google Groups.

Thanks Peter.

I'll definitely check in on this. How is your book
going? I heard chapter 1 came in and it was in 
good shape. ;-)

I hope you are doing well.

Hi Peter,
 
The hotels are the ones that rent out the tent. They are all lined up on the hotel grounds : )) So much for being one with nature, more like being one with a couple dozen tour groups and nature.
I have about 100M of pictures from that trip. I can go through them and get you jpgs of my favorite scenic pictures.
 
Where are you and Jocelyn now? New York? Will you come to Tokyo for Chinese New Year? Perhaps to see the two of you then. I will go to Thailand for winter holiday to see my mom : )
 
Take care,
